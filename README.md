## About the Video Course
Integrating Elasticsearch with PHP and Laravel will help you to achieve just what the title suggests. This video series will walk you through everything required to integrate Elasticsearch with your PHP / Laravel web application. The sections in the course will build from the ground up, starting with setting up your development environment all the way through creating a functional, searchable web application.
First you’ll set up your dev environment using Laravel Homestead, which provides a pre-packaged vagrant environment in which we’ll install Elasticsearch and set up our Laravel PHP application. Using this environment, we’ll start working through Elasticsearch basics, moving on to using two different Elasticsearch PHP clients before integrating Elasticsearch with our Laravel model using Laravel Scout.
This video series will not only leave you with the skills required to build a functional Elasticsearch integration in your PHP / Laravel web application, but will give you the knowledge required to extend this integration and solve real problems with real world applications.
